        The Kitchen vs Table chat was a refreshing take on the type of experience we can expect at Devbootcamp. To be frank, I think my biggest fear coming into this experience was the possibility that this was nothing more than just a profit turning institution. Hearing Shereef speak about how you need to own your experience at Dev made me realize that I had certain expectations that I didn't even really knew I had. To a certain extent, I DID view this bootcamp curriculum as a consumer. A means to an end. Don't get me wrong, I've never been more excited and committed to something than this journey I am about to take. What I realized from listening to this video is that I need to take more responsibility and action for the outcome of my experience, instead of having certain expectations for the program. I'm excited and highly motivated to take charge of my actions and I know that if I come with the right mindset, I can make this the most fulfilling and rewarding experience of my life.

        My impression of DBC after seeing this video is at an all time high. Shereef sure knows how to motivate and inspire his students! His transparency and his ability to relate made a big impression on me. It reassured me that this is the type of learning experience where I can grow both as a developer and a better person. As long as I am accountable and not afraid to fail, I can reach my goals.
