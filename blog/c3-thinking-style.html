  <h2>Your Thinking Style and Learning</h2>

       During week 1, we took the Gregoric Thinking Style quiz to determine what kind of thinking style we possessed. After taking the quiz, I came to the conclusion that I was an Abstract Sequential Thinker. The Abstract part of my brain enables me to visualize and conceive ideas that aren't presented to me in a tangible manner. It allows me to use more of my intuition and imagination and allows me to look behind the "subtle implications".
       The Sequential part of my mind allows me to organize information in a linear step by step manner. It seems that my train of thought is more logical and prefer a step by step process in order to figure out a problem.

        After googling a bunch of references to see how I can use this knowledge to apply my learning at DBC, I came up with the following ideas.
        <ol>
          <li>I need to be able to follow traditional procedures</li>
          <li>I am able/prefer to work alone</li>
          <li>I need to be able to able to have a written structure in terms of taking notes</li>
          <li>Will be more sure of myself when I am able to back my ideas with reading references and "expert" sources</li>
          <li>I need to be 100% sure of myself</li>
          <li>Might need more time to learn material thoroughly</li>
          <li>Need to utilize my abilities to think outside the box</li>
        </ol>

        During the first three weeks at phase 0, the hardest part of my experience so far was peer pairing with other people. I tend to have a hard time being in the driver seat and not being able to navigate the way I want to solve the problem. I tend to get frustrated with some of the direction that I was being fed, which leads me to even more frustration. I think that being a Abstract Sequential thinker, I need to be able to learn how to work better with other people and take directions in a more receptive manner. Don't get me wrong, most of the pairing sessions were awesome, and the people I met were very nice and we fed off each other very well, with the exception of one pairing.
        Going forward, I need to remind myself that we need to perform each role to the best of our ability, even if it means that we don't solve problems the way I want it.

        Growth vs Fixed Mindset. When we first took the test to figure out what kind of mindset we identified with, I was initially discouraged that mine was a Fixed Mindset. It seemed that all the positive attributes belonged to having a Growth Mindset. After being able reflect, I decided that being discouraged was not the right thing to do! If I wanted to change how my I learned new concepts and grow as a person and a developer, I realized I needed to be able to learn from my failures and not be afraid to ask questions. Everyday it is a struggle, and certain times during phase 0, I got very frustrated at times when I couldn't come up with a solution right away. Knowing that I wanted to change my mindset, I asked as many questions I had on our google communities without the fear of looking stupid. I wanted to be able to be vulnerable and learn from others by realizing my mistakes. I understand it's not going to happen overnight, but it is a process that I am working on daily. Just being able to be more fearless and not get insecure about things I don't know will be beneficial to me in the long run!
