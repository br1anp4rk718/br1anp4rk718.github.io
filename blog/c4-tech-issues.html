     <h2>Issues in Tech - Online Security</h2>
  <h4>July 12th 2015</h4>

    For this week's cultural blog, I am going to be talking about what I learned about online security. These days it seems that every other month we hear about some business that gets hacked and allows hackers to obtain sensitive information about people's credit cards, and other valuable information that is meant to be kept private. I was curious about how these hackers go about obtaining these information and how we would be equipped to best protect ourselves.

    It seems that our best protection against these hackers comes from our firewalls. Firewalls are a network security system that controls the incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a specific set of rules. Most typtical firewalls establishes a sort of barrier between a trusted and secure internal network and other networks(webpages, the internet in whole). The reason why a firewall is important is that the way these hackers obtain information is by somehow obtaining your ip address during this transaction, and doing god knows what with it.

    One of the basic ways that people can secure online privacy is just to be aware of potential threats and have an up to date anti virus program. Another neat trick I learned while researching up on this topic was that if you are about to enter sensitive information, make sure that the beginning of the URL reads "https://" rather than "http://"". The extra S indicates that the website is secured by a digital certificate.

    There are many more ways that online security can be compromised besides the use of obtaining IP addresses. Scammers sending out malicious emails, false offers, and viruses through program downloads are just a few of the many ways your computer can be compromised. But if you are careful and are aware of potential threats that might come up on your computer, you have a better chance to protect yourself!
