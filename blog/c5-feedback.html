  <h1>Cultural Blog</h1>
  <h2>Feedback!</h2>

    Welcome to week 5! It's definitely been a roller coaster ride so far during phase 0! This week's cutural topic is going to be regarding the feedback we've received and given out up till this point. I think for the most part, the pairing sessions have gone smoothly in terms of everyone knowing their roles and coming into the session prepared and ready to solve the problem. The great pairing sessions usually occur when your partner is up to date with the curriculum, and took the time to really go through the process that Dev outlines in terms of what we need to be talking about, and staying true to each persons role in the pairing sessions. There have been few instances though, I was frustrated in terms of what was happening during these meet ups.

    The pairing sessions where I came out of feeling like it was a genuine partnership, were truly rewarding. Being able to feed off your partner and work with a good flow requires both people being attentive and having a good understanding of that weeks curriculum.
    It's a great feeling when you figure out a challenge with your partner while tossing ideas around without deviating too much from the protocol set out by Dev in terms of driving and navigating.

    The sessions where I felt really frustrated were the ones where I felt that my partner either didn't care about the work being completed, or if your partner completely ignored the driver/navigator protocol. There were times when we started off a session by assigning roles, and those roles were completely disregarded when we started working on the problem. I think just learning how I react to certain things during these sessions will ultimately only help me down the line.

    The feedback I've received so far have been very helpful in terms of reassuring me that I have been on track. It's a great feeling when your peers acknowledge that you were beneficial to the pairing, and that their experience was overall a positive one.
    Most of the reviews did not include something I needed to work on...not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. I think overall though, I know personally that I need to be more patient and understanding of everyones schedule. I feel like sometimes my frustrations were evident when the pairing sessions did not go the way I wanted it to, and reflecting back, I think it was pretty selfish of me.

    Writing feedback for everyone was pretty challenging. There were sessions where I felt nothing went wrong, and it was hard finding something that they can improve upon. Other sessions, it was hard to write something nice without being too specific or not nice. Overall though, I think it's a great way for students to get an idea of what they need to work on technically and culturally, and also introduces programmers to the concept of peer pairing.
