      <h2>Stereotype Threats</h2>

    Stereotype Threats. What does that mean? For me personally, I initially thought that it meant to threaten someone using Stereotypes.... I know, don't laugh ok? So when I had a chance to dig deeper into what Stereotype Threats meant, it was pretty mindblowing. To sum it up in a very general definition, Stereotype Threats are when an individual is susceptible to harm and self sabotage, due to negative stereotypes that are centered around their ethnicity or gender.
    So my initial guess wasn't that off..<br><br>

    An example of a Stereotype Threat would be the following. Imagine a caucasian student, about to take a math test. He's in a class with a lot of asian students. The caucasian student starts feeling subconciously insignificant due to the fact that he thinks he "knows" that asians are just really good at math. This perception creates a negative and self esteem lowering feeling, and it results in the student getting lower grades than what he would've gotten, if he never heard of the stereotypes of asians and math. Pretty interesting huh?! Seems like there's been countless studies done on Stereotype Threats and how it negatively effects the results of whatever they are trying to do. <br><br>

    There was a study done on Stereotpe Threats where students were told that they were taking a test to measure their intellect. Another group of studedents were told that the test could not measure their intellectual ability. The African American students in Group A performed worse than the students in Group B. In Group B, the African American students performed just as well as the other ethnicities in the group. <br><br>

    Some of you may say, what are the variables when these studies are done? How was their intellect measured in comparison with the other different ethnic students? What are their socio-economic statuses?
    It's hard to figure out what all the variables are without getting into too much depth, but I would like to think that the research was done with consideration to a lot of different factors. If you trust in the research as I do, it's a pretty staggering discovery. The fact that you can self sabotage yourself due to mainstream perceptions in regards to race or gender, is a scary thought. If these studies are actually legit, just educating educators in how to present tests to a ethnically diverse group of students could potentially mean big results! I'm trying to remember how many times before a test I felt deflated and hopeless. Maybe I can now blame some of my poor grades due to Stereotype Threats?
