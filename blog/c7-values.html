  <h2>Affirmation and Stereotype Threats</h2>
  <h4>August 2nd, 2015</h4>

    Last week we talked a little about Stereotype Threats and how it can subconsciously affect your performance in a negative way when you are aware of a negative stereotype concerning your race or sex. Today we are going to talk a little bit about how to combat these Stereotype Threats. One of the suggested ways that you can combat Stereotype Threats is by affirmation. This pretty much means that an individual can affirm their self worth by thinking of characteristics or skills they possess which are important to the individual.

    For myself personally, the list below is a few  characteristics that help me affirm my self worth. <br><br>
    <ul>
      <li>Accomplishment</li>
      <li>Accountability</li>
      <li>Control</li>
      <li>Growth</li>
      <li>Self Respect</li>
    </ul>

    On a scale of 1-5, (5 being the most I try to live up to these values) I would have to say that I would give myself a 2 or a 3.  <br><br>

    If I had to pick one value from the list above that means the most to me, I would have to choose Self-Respect. The reason why this value is the most imporatant to myself, is because it ties in a lot of my insecurities when there is a lack of it. When I get things done and accomplished, it all goes back into my self worth and how I view myself. I feel like I am at my full potential when I have confidence in myself and my abilities.<br><br>

    The last topic that someone asked my advice is for was regarding Personal development. I believe this kind of ties into Self Respect and Confidence because you want to be able to grow as a person, and be able to grow in the areas where you feel you are lacking. <br><br>

    Going forward, I need to be able to reinforce my confidence consistently so that I can avoid Stereotype Threats. Just being able to identify your weaknesses as a person and working on them is something I plan on doing going forward! Good luck to us all!
