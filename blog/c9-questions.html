    I believe that learning how to ask good questions will be an important skill going forward. In order to get help from your peers, it's vital that all the information and the format of the question be in a manner where it is easy for your peers to understand.

    When asking a question, it is important to remember that nobody will be able to help you if you do not explain and clarify yourself in the most practical way. I learned that the best way to start off when asking a question to your peers is to start it off with a title that summarizes the problem you have at hand. Nothing too long, but nothing too short and generic. You want to make the question very easy to follow! By taking a little bit more time to include all the relevant information ( whether it's your code or links to sandboxes) , you might be surprised at how people will be responding to you!

    Another important part of posting questions is to always proof-read. As stated above, it's important to make sure it's easy to follow! Making sure your links are working right and to have all the relavant code included in the question, will benefit both you and the people helping you.

    To sum it up, when asking questions, I believe by taking a little bit more time to format your question the right way will make a world of a difference! It's important to remember that you are trying to help the people that are helping you, and by giving a little bit more effort, everyone will be happy =]
