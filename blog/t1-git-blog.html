  <h2>Version Control</h1>

        What is Version Control??
        Version control is exactly what it sounds like. It is a way to control the progress of your work by saving certain versions of it. Think of it something like a checkpoint. With version control, you can keep track of all your files and it keeps a log of all the changes you've made and when you made them! Imagine if you introduced an error to your work, but can't seem to figure out what's wrong? If you took the necessary steps to "commit", "add", and "push" your work, you can go back to an earlier version of it and work back from there! This is all possible with the help of something called "Git".

        You can think of Git as a version control system that helps developers keep track of their changes that were made on their program/project. It is a program that ANYBODY can download for free onto your own personal computer! Git helps you save certain versions of your work with certain commands that you can easily learn from the command line. Commands such as "Git -commit" and "Git add" helps you keep track of versions of your work, so that you can easily reference back to what kind of changes were made and when they were made!
        Git also has the ability to create a "branch" of your work. This pretty much means you can replicate your work, make changes without affecting your main version, and when your ready, you can merge them all together!

        Github and Git are not the same thing! Even though they sound similar, it has major differences. Github is an online, remote "hub" that allows users to store or file "repositories", which you can then share and work collectively with other developers! 
        The reason why you should be using Github is that the developer community often works with multiple people on certain projects. If you didn't have this online platform where you can store your files, not everyone would be able to work on the project at the same time with the same files! With the help of Github and Git, you can collectively work together with as many people as you want, and once your ready, you can help to merge all the work seamlessly! Sounds cool huh?
