      What are Arrays and Hashes?
      Arrays and Hashes are both used in Ruby in order to store a bunch of data! While the syntax to write out Arrays and Hashes might be different, they are both used when you want to be able to store a significant ( or just a little ) data so that you can access the information within the Array or Hashes whenever you want. How do you access the data stored in Arrays and Hashes? Good question! Arrays and Hashes are both indexed collections. What do I mean by that? Both can be accessible using certain syntax. With Arrays, the indexes are integers, where the first value in an array starts from the index "0", and goes incrementally up by 1. For Hashes, you can access the "values" using "keys" that are associated with each value in a Hash.

        Before I go any further, let me show you how Hashes and Arrays look like.
        <br>
        <br>
        Ex of an Array:
        <br>
        <br>
        array = []  <== this is an empty array with no data.
        <br>
        <br>
        array = ['hello', 'bye', 9] <== as you can see, you can store all types of different objects in an array. Strings and integers are included in the example above, but you can also store any object in Ruby (Hashes, other Arrays, methods!).

        Ex of Hashes:
        <br>
        <br>
        hash = {}  - An empty hash
        <br>
        <br>
        hash = {:ramen => 5, :rice => 1, :beef => 10} - keys and symbols. The key starts with ":" followed by the key name, and it points to the value associated with each key.

    </p>
    <p class='vs'>
        Now that you know how arrays and Hashes look like, let me show you how you would create them in Ruby. Both arrays and Hashes can be created using literal and constructor notations.
        <br>
        <br>
        Arrays:
        <br>
        <br>
        Array = []
        Array.new
        <br>
        <br>
        Hashes:
        <br>
        <br>
        hash = Hash.new(0)
        hash = {}


    </p>
    <p class='vs'>
        As you see from the examples above, Hashes and Arrays are great ways to store a large amount of information. You can easily iterate over both, making life a lot easier for the programmer!
