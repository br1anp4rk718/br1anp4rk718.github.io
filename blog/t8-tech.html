    There are two types of memory in a computer. There's "Read only memory", also referred to as "ROM". There's also "Random Access Memory", which is also called "RAM". ROM is the part of the computer that stores the permament memory that holds important information that allows the computer to do simple functions, like running a program, or being able to launch a game from your computer. RAM stores the input data that can be changed or erased. It is considered the "volatile" memory, because most of the data that it holds will be rebooted or erased when the computer is turned off. Both of these memory types are essential for a computer to be able to process things faster and efficiently. The more RAM and ROM you have on your computer, the better it is! It will allow programs and other applications to be ran at a faster and more efficient pace.<br><br>
